# Window-Arrange
The script allows you to save, according to a given list, the coordinates of windows 10. Made for yourself. Optimality is not guaranteed, I wrote a script along the way, the main thing works. Suggestions for improvement are welcome. PS: I'm not a programmer.

Save button: takes a list from a file and saves the coordinates to the same file.

Load button: arranges the windows by the list from the list file with coordinates.
